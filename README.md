**Game History:**
-----------------

You control a little amnesiac who runs around helping out these rabbit-ish
creatures called Mimigas while trying to find your way out of the giant cave
inside the floating island which makes up the game's setting.

You can expand your health meter by collecting Life Capsules, while you can get
stronger by collecting energy to boost your firearms output. 

Each weapon can be built up to the maximum level (3) fairly quickly,
but taking damage will drain energy from its experience meter,
sometimes causing it to level down. 

Given how quickly they power up this only tends to be an issue during
boss fights, and even then thereÂ´s usually plenty of opportunities for
collecting more weapon energy.

**Installation dependency:**
----------------------------

On Debian/Ubuntu/GNU/Linux you can get all necessary packages by typing:

    # apt install cmake libpng-dev libsdl2-dev libsdl2-mixer-dev

When all these dependencies are installed to start compiling the game.
To create the archive binary, do it from the source directory.

**Creating directory and accessing:**

    $ mkdir -p build && cd build

**Starting to build:**

    $ cmake ..

**Starting compilation:**

    $ make

**Running the game:**
