Special Thanks to...
- "Shih Tzu", for facilitating contact with Pixel himself.
- Pixel himself, for creating the game, allowing us to produce an
  English version of it, and for putting up with what must have seemed an awful
  amount of nagging questions on my part. :)
  You've got the patience of a saint, and this wouldn't be done without you!
- "sandcrab", who produced an alternate translation of the text for Pixel.
- Tomato & Bugcatcher, for helping out on a couple tough bits in the text.
  Cheers!
