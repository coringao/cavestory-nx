<Cave Story ~ Doukutsu Monogatari> (c) 2004 Studio Pixel
(Graphics, Music, Sound, Story, and Characters - Property of Studio Pixel)

Most of the files contained were created by Daisuke Amaya, otherwise known by
the stage name "Pixel", unless otherwise specified.

This program is freeware. Neither Studio Pixel[1] nor Aeon Genesis[2] is
responsible if it does Bad Things to your computer.
(Of course, it shouldn't, but that's beside the point.)

I used them without permission. You absolutely can't use these in anything
commercial. Nicalis[3] owns the exclusive rights (in the west at least).

Not to mention it would be pretty disrespectful to the original creator.
