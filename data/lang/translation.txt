Well, that's not an actual translation, really, just an original scripts decoded and converted to UTF-8.
However, i slightly modified TextBox.pbm, to make yesno box same size as in english version,
because all other translations use it as base and i really don't want to change sprites.sif for Japanese only.

Plus, there's translations for menu, etc.

Script translations are from Шедевр.
Graphics are from tag-team / lupus.

Sadly, tag-team translation is better, but unusable (it uses runglish, e.g. maps russian chars to english ones).
So feel free to improve.
